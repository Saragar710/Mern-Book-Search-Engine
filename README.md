# Mern-Book-Search-Engine

## Description
For this app, a user is asked to search for a specific book and hit the submit button. Once you submit you are given a few options for the book you chose. From there you can save your favorite books or delete them. You also have the option of loggin in or signing up for this website. Using local storage your book choices are saved.

## Installation
Once you run npm i then you npm run develop to kick off the app. Because I am utilizing concurrently when you run the develop command it starts both the server and the client so the website loads seamlessly.

## Usage
A few of the technologies I used were:
React
Vite
Express
Apollo
bootstrap
concurrently
mongoose
bcrypt
nodemon and jsonwebtoken
